<h1>S Dharshan</h1>
<div class="subtitle">
Entry-Level Data & AI Analyst | Python, Excel, Power BI, Prompt Engineering
</div>

<p>
Entry-level Data and AI Analyst with a strong academic foundation in mathematics and hands-on exposure
to data analysis, Excel, Power BI, and prompt engineering. Experienced in building AI-assisted analytical
systems, performing data visualization, and working on structured problem-solving projects.
Seeking an opportunity in a service-based or analytics-driven organization to contribute to
data-driven solutions and continuously grow as a professional.
</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a B.Sc Mathematics graduate with a keen interest in applying data analysis and AI techniques
to real-world business problems. I focus on building practical, well-structured solutions rather
than theoretical implementations. My experience includes virtual internships, workshops, and
project-based learning in analytics and AI.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>AI-Driven Code Bug Analyzer</h3>
<p>
Developed an AI-assisted code analysis system to identify logical errors, common bugs,
and potential code quality issues. The system uses structured prompt engineering techniques
with evaluation and safety constraints to improve accuracy and reduce hallucinated outputs.
</p>
<p><strong>Technologies & Skills:</strong> Python, Prompt Engineering, Code Analysis, Logical Reasoning</p>
