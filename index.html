<h1>S Dharshan</h1>
<div class="subtitle">
Entry-Level Data Analyst | Python, Excel, Power BI
</div>

<p>
Entry-level Data Analyst with a strong academic foundation in mathematics and hands-on
experience working with structured datasets using Python, Excel, and Power BI.
Experienced in data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization to derive insights
that support decision-making. Built AI-assisted analytical tools as part of project-based
learning and hackathons. Seeking an entry-level role in a service-based or analytics-driven
organization to work on real datasets and grow analytical depth.
</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
I am a B.Sc Mathematics graduate with a strong interest in data analysis and problem solving.
I focus on understanding data thoroughly, applying structured logic, and communicating insights
clearly. My learning experience includes hands-on projects, virtual internships, workshops,
and participation in national-level hackathons.
</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>AI-Driven Code Bug Analyzer</h3>
<p>
Developed an AI-assisted code analysis tool to identify logical errors, common bug patterns,
and maintainability issues in Python programs. The system analyzes source code structure and
generates issue reports using rule-based logic combined with prompt-driven evaluation.
</p>
<p>
Tested the system on multiple Python code samples, reduced false-positive outputs by refining
prompt constraints, and documented limitations where automated analysis cannot replace
manual code review.
</p>
<p><strong>Key Focus Areas:</strong> Code logic analysis, evaluation, error handling, limitations</p>
<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Prompt-Based Analysis, Static Analysis Concepts</p>

<h3>Resume Screening & Interview Preparation System</h3>
<p>
Built a system that compares resumes with job descriptions to identify keyword gaps and generate
role-specific interview questions. Applied structured prompt design, evaluation techniques,
and bias-aware constraints to improve reliability and reduce incorrect outputs.
</p>
<p><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, Prompt-Based Evaluation, Text Analysis</p>

<h3>Smart India Hackathon 2025 – Indoor Mapping System</h3>
<p>
Participated as a team member in Smart India Hackathon 2025 to design an indoor navigation and
mapping solution for large buildings. Contributed to problem understanding, logical flow design,
and solution planning under time-bound conditions.
</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Problem Solving, Team Collaboration, System Thinking</p>
